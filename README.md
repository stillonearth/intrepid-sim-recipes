# intrepid-sim-recipes

A set of recipes for Intrepid robotic sim.

1. Train simple walk policy for wheeled-legged robot [train_urdf_robot_policty.ipynb](train_urdf_robot_policty.ipynb) using stable_baselines3 A2C algorithm.
2. Control drone from [control_drone.ipynb](control_drone.ipynb); implement **body rate**, **roll/pitch/yaw**, **altitude**, **lateral position** and **yaw** controllers by reading drone sensors and controlling rotors.
